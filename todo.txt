im doing a 3d modeling software.
raster data Vs. vector data (point cloud data).

function multiply matrix
function debug matrix (diplay a matrix on the screen)

MATRIX FUNCTIONS:
translation
rotation (autour de certain axe: x, y, et z)
scale
multiplcation:
	- par une matrice
	- par un scalaire


idea to print the basis vector:
have i, and j
and k is the cross product of i and j.
projection of all of them.


to get the coordinate of a vector, for example on the z axis
we take its dot product on the basis k vector.
